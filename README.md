## Overview

What's the big fuss over IT automation?  Well, more than anything, the excitement is about the sorts of things that you _don't_ have to do when automation is on your side.  Things like _not_ having to either copy and paste configuration changes to dozens (maybe hundreds) of different systems or repeat the same click, click, click, click, click-through-the-UI marathon over, and over, and over..._every single time_ there's a need to make a bulk change :rage:.

To automate configuration and management workflows for network devices, we need to learn to write some form of automation-specific code, and the **NETCONF** protocol makes that possible.  **NETCONF** provides a programmatic way to automate the network device workflows based on the predictable data structures found in YANG models.

This guide will walk you through some hands-on exercises that help teach and give you a place to practice using Python to automate workflows with **NETCONF**.  You'll get the most from these exercises if you have some familiarity with:

- :snake: Python fundamentals.
- :scroll: Managing and transposing structured data between XML and Python objects.
- :desktop_computer: Interpreting YANG models.
