The JupyterLab server will allow you to work through a series of Python-based, NETCONF exercises using a web browser. Lab Requirements \u00b6 You only need a few things to start working through the labs: A Docker runtime environment. Docker Desktop for Windows or macOS , Docker for Linux , etc. A web browser with JupyterLab support . Lab Setup Instructions \u00b6 We provide instructions for three different lab setup options. Choose the option that best suits your needs and then follow the step-by-step directions: Lab Setup Options Auto-provision the environment in the WWT Programmability Foundations On-Demand Lab . The best chioce if you don't have a place to install and run Docker or if you need an on-demand learning and test environment. Run a pre-built Container in your own Docker runtime environment. The best choice if you want the quickest lab setup experience and ideal if you already have Docker running in your development environment. Use the Visual Studio Code Development Container in the Git Repository . The best choice if you want an easy environment to both run the lab and also to access or modify source files. Auto-provision the environment in the WWT Programmability Foundations Lab Step 1 Launch a new copy of the WWT Programmability Foundations On-Demand Lab and click View Labs : Step 2 From the My Labs page, click Access Lab : Step 3 Click the Open in ATC Lab Gateway button : Step 4 If prompted, log on with your WWT.com Platform Account Credentials : Step 5 Click the System Tray icon and mouse over the Docker icon to reveal the service status: Attention The icon may take a minute or so to appear. Step 6 The Docker service is ready when a small exclamation point appears over the Docker icon : Attention It may be a few minutes before the Docker service is ready. Important Occasionally, the Docker Desktop service does not start on its own. Windows may ask you if you want to start the Docker service and then request permission for Net Command\u200b to run. You may safely confirm both actions. Step 7 A PowerShell script will customize the lab environment automatically although and you need to paste a long command into a PowerShell window to start that process: Tip Click the PowerShell icon in the taskbar to open a new PowerShell window. Then, copy the entire command below to your clipboard. Right-click in the PowerShell window to paste the command Press your Enter or Return key to run the command. Set-Executionpolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted -Force ; Set-Location \\ Users \\ admin ; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://devasc-netconf.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/setup_lab.ps1' -OutFile ' setup_lab . ps1 \u2019 ; .\\ setup_lab . ps1 What to do if you see a 'Docker Desktop process is not running' error message: From time to time, the Windows desktop in this lab takes a lengthy amount of time to successfully start the Docker Desktop process and, rarely, Windows will fail to start Docker Desktop. If Windows cannot start Docker Desktop, your first indication will be an error message when you run the PowerShell script that configures the lab. Docker for Windows Process Status As the PowerShell error message indicates, PowerShell will attempt to start or restart the Docker Desktop process. After a few seconds, the Docker Desktop application will open behind the PowerShell window, and you may bring it to the foreground to monitor the status. A teal-colored icon in the lower-left corner of the Docker Desktop application indicates the Docker process is running and you should be able to re-run the PowerShell script to configure the lab environment. Sometimes, Windows takes 5-10 minutes to start the Docker process. An orange-colored icon in the lower-left corner of the Docker Desktop application indicates the Docker process is not running and you have a couple of options: Wait for around 10 minutes to see if Windows can start the Docker process. Launch a new instance of the WWT Programmability Foundations On-Demand Lab . Step 8 Wait a few minutes for the automated lab setup to complete: Step 9 Within a few minutes, when the lab is ready to use, a Chrome browser will open a **JupyterLab URL**. Open the **devasc-data-formats** folder from the navigation pane: Step 10 Next, open the lab folder: Step 11 Open the part_i_python folder: Step 12 Open the file **python.ipynb** and follow the step-by-step instructions in the main pane: Lab Restart Instructions The lab setup process creates a shortcut on the Windows desktop, which will help you restore the lab environment in the event the JupyterLab browser tab closes, Windows restarts, etc. Notice The Restart Lab shortcut re-launches JupyterLab (including the Chrome browser tab) and will only take a few seconds to complete. Double-clicking this shortcut will NOT cause you to lose any of your lab progress.","title":"Getting Started With The Lab"},{"location":"sections/section_1/#getting-started-with-the-lab","text":"","title":"Getting Started With The Lab"},{"location":"sections/section_1/#lab-overview","text":"The lab environment runs in a Docker Container which hosts a web-based, interactive Python environment called JupyterLab .
